These things will need to happen to implement recording:

On arm:
Set up files to record to.
Tag capture channels with files they'll record to.
Make sure there are enough buffers.
Allocate clips.

On record start:
Name files.
Install clips, mark them as recording so we don't try to play them.

On record:
Capture buffers are sent back to DAW thread with their associated files.
Update clips.

Tracks will also need their "capture_channels" vector, for input monitoring.  We'll install new ones on arming, input change, and interface change.  Deletion will be lazy.  We won't worry about the track holding onto it when unarmed, nor about installing duplicate ones unnecessarily.  Actually, maybe only send one on input change (or interface change) when armed, and don't care about stale ones on unarmed tracks.

Overdubbing with a one-second buffer resulted in the the overdub playing two seconds late, (more or less) as expected.  So we need to start the new clip two buffers into the file, and keep recording for two buffers after "stopping" recording.
