These things will need to happen to implement recording:

On arm:
Set up files to record to.
Tag capture channels with files they'll record to.
Make sure there are enough buffers.
Allocate clips.

On record start:
Name files.
Install clips, mark them as recording so we don't try to play them.

On record:
Capture buffers are sent back to DAW thread with their associated files.
Update clips.
